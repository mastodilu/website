Alarms are gathered by a JMS queue, enriched with metadata and forwarded to a web server in a CSV and to the bank\u0026rsquo; syslog server. The entire flow counts more than one hunded processors, is replicated on three nodes using Zookeeper embedded and is capable of handling several thousands of alarms each minute having minimum impact on the nodes. The system is monitored using Nifi\u0026rsquo;s APIs. Simplified the enabling and disabling of VPN access for consultants of an important Italian Internet Service Provider. The system is composed of a VueJS frontend and a Go server. User authentication is done querying the active directory and sessions are maintained with cookies. A PostgreSQL database stores all the data and allows the structuring of relations between employees and the groups of consultants they\u0026rsquo;re responsible for. Architected and automated the writing of templates of instructions to configure network equipment. Configurations are built through a responsive website using Go templates and bootstrap and served with a Go server that stores data in an hybrid storage system that uses both PostgreSQL and MongoDB. The project is containerized using Podman. Implemented a classification script in Go that calls IBM\u0026rsquo;s Watson Natural Language APIs to fastly classify millions of records per CSV thanks to the super efficient Go\u0026rsquo;s multithreading system. Introduced an artificial neural network to classify incoming tickets using a bag of word matrix with 5000 TF-IDF features as input of a 4 layer Artificial Neural Network built with Keras and Tensorflow. Engineered a classification model for a Milan University to classify students based on their probability to complete their studies there, using pandas, nltk, sklearn to fit a Support Vector Classifier to the data. The model was later refined with Grid Search Algorithm.
